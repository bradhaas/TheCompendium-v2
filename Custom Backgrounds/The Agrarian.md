## Lore
*Your horse rears up as the herd of cows trots gently in front of you. They've been on edge since a drake carried one of your sows off a few days ago - which coincidentally is also why your two handed sledgehammer is strapped to your back. You know that you don't stand a chance against even a  young drake, but the worn leather grip of your hammer comforts you nonetheless. You aren't scared. Your mother always told you that the land gives, but lately it's felt like it's done more taking away. You won't survive much longer at this rate - it's time to defend your livlihood. *

This is your farm - there are many like it, but this one is yours. You've grown to become an expert
