## Lore
*You nervously fidget with the wrought iron ring with your family's crest you're wearing, realizing how out of place it makes you feel in the mercenary company office. The clerk shoots you a puzzled look as you size up a few of the men in front of you. These men are all wrong - they all look so.. haggard. And dirty. You're trying to put together a group of like minded explorers - a team ready to take on the frontier and carefully document new magical / biological / technological findings with rigor and scientific acumen. No no, none of these people will do. You'll have to keep looking.*

Your wealthy upbringing has always gotten you out of trouble, and after struggling to find your path in your 20s your parents have pulled some strings and gotten you placed in charge of an exploratory mission that your local government is planning.

Perhaps you're a Shoshone scientist trying to better understand the tools that refugees are bringing in to your land, or maybe you're an American biologist looking to better document the magical flora and fauna that continue to be discovered as the nation attempts to expand west.

Either way - your goal is to find a group of like minded individuals to explore, document, and investigate the unknown frontier.
## Feature
Choose one of the following
### Name Dropper
You know and have met any number of powerful people across the land—and some of them might even remember you. You might be able to wrangle minor assistance from a major figure in the campaign, at the DM's discretion. Additionally, the common folk treat you with deference, and your heritage and the stories you tell might be good for a free meal or a place to sleep.
### Arcane Learnings
Your studies offer you insights others wouldn't be able to glean. The arcane has grown familiar, and as a result you can identify at least one major property/characteristic of any arcane item or creature you encounter.

### Wanderer
You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you. In addition, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other people each day, provided that the land offers berries, small game, water, and so forth.

## Origins
|d6|Origin|
|---|---|
|1|Someone stole something precious from your people. You tracked the thief to the city gates, but finding clues in an urban environment is very different from tracking someone across the wilderness. You don't know where to go from here, but your people need you to succeed.|
|2|You've always been fascinated by the glitter and glamor of city life, so different from the slow pace of life in your homeland. Now you're here, ready to make your mark in the world, but unsure how to begin.|
|3|War, plague, famine, or a marauding monster ravaged your home, forcing you to flee for your life. You don't even know how many of your people survived or where to find them. Alone or accompanied by a handful of equally bereft survivors, you must navigate a new life that you never asked for.|
|4|You were captured by kidnappers and taken far from your home. The Knights of the Unicorn freed you and brought you here, but now you're on your own.|
|5|You were exiled for breaking a trivial-seeming taboo. For this seemingly minor transgression, you lost your friends, family, and homeland in one fell swoop, and were given little choice but to strike out on your own.|
|6|A peddler once brought something astonishing to your homeland—a Gondan clockwork, shimmering cloth of gold, a trained speaking bird, or some other small wonder—and told you that it came from Baldur's Gate. You've come to see the source of such wonders, and perhaps learn to create them.|

### Specialty

You've been to strange places and seen things that others cannot begin to fathom. Consider some of the distant lands you have visited, and how they impacted you. You can roll on the following table to determine your occupation during your time in the wild, or choose one that best fits your character.

### Suggested Characteristics

Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.

|d8|Personality Trait|
|---|---|
|1|I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.|
|2|I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.|
|3|I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to.|
|4|I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.|
|5|I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.|
|6|I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.|
|7|I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.|
|8|I was, in fact, raised by wolves.|

|d6|Ideal|
|---|---|
|1|Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)|
|2|Greater Good. It is each person's responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Good)|
|3|Honor. If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. (Lawful)|
|4|Might. The strongest are meant to rule. (Evil)|
|5|Nature. The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. (Neutral)|
|6|Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)|

|d6|Bond|
|---|---|
|1|My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.|
|2|An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.|
|3|I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.|
|4|I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.|
|5|I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.|
|6|It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.|

|d6|Flaw|
|---|---|
|1|I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.|
|2|There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.|
|3|I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.|
|4|I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.|
|5|Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.|
|6|Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.|
