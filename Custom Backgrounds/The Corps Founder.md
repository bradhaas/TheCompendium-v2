## Lore
*You nervously fidget with the wrought iron ring with your family's crest you're wearing, realizing how out of place it makes you feel in the mercenary company office. The clerk shoots you a puzzled look as you size up a few of the men in front of you. These men are all wrong - they all look so.. haggard. And dirty. You're trying to put together a group of like minded explorers - a team ready to take on the frontier and carefully document new magical / biological / technological findings with rigor and scientific acumen. No no, none of these people will do. You'll have to keep looking*

Your wealthy upbringing has always gotten you out of trouble, and after struggling to find your path in your 20s your parents have pulled some strings and gotten you placed in charge of an exploratory mission that your local government is planning.

Perhaps you're a Shoshone scientist trying to better understand the tools that refugees are bringing in to your land, or maybe you're an American biologist looking to better document the magical flora and fauna that continue to be discovered as the nation attempts to expand west.

Either way - your goal is to find a group of like minded individuals to explore, document, and investigate the unknown frontier.
