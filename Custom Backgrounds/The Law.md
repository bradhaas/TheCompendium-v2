## Lore
*In a land of chaos, you are order. In a realm of the unknown, you enforce the known. You bring stability to the untamed, lawless frontier. As you feel the blade of your sword rest against the rapid breathing of the thief you caught in the act, you remind yourself that without law, the natural entropy of the world - magical and not - would run unchecked. Not if you can help it.*

What prompted you to come be the sheriff at the edge of your world? Do you dream of something bigger? Or are you running away from something? Either way, you know that the frontier is no place the soft. Out here, you either fall in line, or you die.

Whether you are a renegade pushing the rule of law westward or a sympathetic figure looking to enforce societal norms as refugees flood the borders of your land - you hold the status quo.
