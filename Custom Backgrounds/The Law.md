## Lore
*In a land of chaos, you are order. In a realm of the unknown, you enforce the known. You bring stability to the untamed, lawless frontier. As you feel the blade of your sword rest against the rapid breathing of the thief you caught in the act, you remind yourself that without law, the natural entropy of the world - magical and not - would run unchecked. Not if you can help it.*

What prompted you to come be the sheriff at the edge of your world? Do you dream of something bigger? Or are you running away from something? Either way, you know that the frontier is no place the soft. Out here, you either fall in line, or you die.

Whether you are a renegade pushing the rule of law westward or a sympathetic figure looking to enforce societal norms as refugees flood the borders of your land - you hold the status quo.
## Feature
Choose one of the following
### Position of Authority
You represent the law, and as a consequence you're either respected or feared by the common folk. Unless given a good reason otherwise, commoners will defer to your authority. You receive advantage on relevant ability checks that involve enforcing the law of the land.
### Official Inquiry
You're experienced at gaining access to people and places to get the information you need. Through a combination of fast-talking, determination, and official-looking documentation, you can gain access to a place or an individual related to a crime you're investigating. Those who aren't involved in your investigation avoid impeding you or pass along your requests. Additionally, local law enforcement has firm opinions about you, viewing you as either a nuisance or one of their own.
### Ear to the Ground
You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.
