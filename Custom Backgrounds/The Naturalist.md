## Feature
### Hot Weather
Living in the open desert has allowed your body to adapt to a range of environmental conditions. You can survive on 1 gallon of water in hot conditions (or 1⁄2 gallon in normal conditions) without being forced to make Constitution saving throws, and you are considered naturally adapted to hot climates. While in a desert, you can read the environment to predict natural weather patterns and temperatures for the next 24 hours, allowing you to cross dangerous terrain at the best times. The accuracy of your predictions is up to the GM, but they should be reliable unless affected by magic or unforeseeable events, such as distant earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.
