## Lore
*Everyone makes a big fuss about how dangerous the frontier is - but to you it's all old hat. It may be hell - but you've survied hell for this long, and by now you can't imagine anything different. Your past battles have changed you, but at this point fighting has become part of who you are. As you swill the liquor in your cup you hear a woman cry out as some local ruffians continue to accost her. You set your glass down on the table. You know they sized you up and decided you weren't a threat. It's time for you to prove them wrong.*

You're the level you are not because you're new to adventuring, but instead because you're adventuring career is in it's twilight. You've already won many battles - everyone in your life keeps telling you it's time to slow down and enjoy retirement. But the frontier has had a different idea. You know that out here, taking a breath is the same as laying down and accepting your fate.
