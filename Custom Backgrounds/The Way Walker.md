## Lore
*You feel along the seam of this dimension looking for weak points. To your surprise, you find one. A small nodule in space, barely noticeable, but to someone with your training there plain as day. You push on it slightly. Widen it. You feel yourself pushing against the natural order as you attempt to force open a way between this world and one beyond. You see a bright light start to permeate through the fabric of reality as you feel sweat bead on your brow. As soon as you feel a rush of excitement, the gap snaps shut. You feel your heart fall. You spent several days tracking magical beasts and farie fire to this point, and just like that it's gone. Oh well. On to the next one.*

You were raised on stories of other worlds. Your master, or clan, made it clear that magic is really just our world touching one beyond. These days it feels harder and harder to touch this magic - but nevertheless you persereve. After all - who can resist the limitless power that lies on the other side of that rift?
## Feature
Choose one of the following
### Planar Explorer
Your travels through the planes of existence have granted you first-hand knowledge of the planar system. There have been others to explore outside the Material Plane, but few have been so lost and yet returned. You have a deeper understanding of the planes you have visited, and how they are connected.
### False Identity
You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.
### Extra Planar Visitor
Whenever you're sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Astral Plane might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit's form by rolling on the visitor table. No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minutes or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor can contain any number of things, from messages and insights to nonsense and red herrings, at the DM's discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understand, even if the Feywild visitor can't speak that language normally.
