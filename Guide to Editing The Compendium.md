[Edit Source](https://github.com/bradhaas/TheCompendium-v2/blob/main/Guide%20to%20Editing%20The%20Compendium.md)``

You can edit this website yourself! All you need is a Github account (I promise you don't need to code anything - it's easy). Step by step instructions are below!

## Join Github and Get Added as a Collaborator
1. Go to [Join GitHub Â· GitHub](https://github.com/signup?source=login) and make an account.

	1. You can skip all this stuff - proceed with the free tier
2. Once you've created an account, let Brad know the email/username - he'll invite you as a collaborator
	Open the invitation in your Github inbox once Brad sends it

	Accept the invitation

4. Once you're an editor, you can edit [[(C0) The Compendium]] whenever you want!

## Edit A Page
1. Navigate to the page you want to edit.
2. Hit the edit source button at the top of the page. If there isn't an edit source link, you can either ask Brad to add one or navigate to the relevant page yourself in the Github Project ([GitHub - bradhaas/TheCompendium-v2](https://github.com/bradhaas/TheCompendium-v2))

	The link is just for convenience - you can edit everything directly through Github if you find it easier
3. Click on the pencil (edit button) in Github at the top of the page

4. You can now edit the page directly! If you want to do any sort of formatting this is Markdown, a simple guide on how to do it is here - [Beginner Guide to Markdown](https://medium.com/@itsjzt/beginner-guide-to-markdown-229adce30074)
	1. You can also just ask Brad to make your notes pretty if you want to - think of this like a quick notepad where you can jot stuff down.
5. Once you're done editing, hit the "Commit Changes" button
	![[Pasted image 20231125174519.png|800]]
6. In the dialog that pops up, hit "Commit Changes". It will be set to this by default, but you'll always want to commit to main branch (you want to edit this Compendium, not your own new version)
	![[Pasted image 20231125174643.png|500]]
7. Your edits won't pop up right away - first they'll merge in to Brad's copy of the notes, then they'll get published to the website later. As long as you can see your edits in github, they'll pop in to the website in not too long!

Let Brad know if you have any questions or issues!
