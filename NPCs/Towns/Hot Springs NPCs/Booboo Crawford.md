### For the Insightful or Survival-focused

While it’s true that not all who wander are lost, Booboo is currently very turned around.
## Summary

### Description
A foppish man of middle age with an overwhelmingly large explorer’s pack strapped to his back, a few pots and pans hanging from straps at his chest, holding a guide book like a mask.
### Voice:

### Personality:
“SEE THE COUNTRYSIDE,” he said. “Explore the wilderness.” This was the advice of Booboo’s physician as he shared the sad news about the man’s impending demise. His body overrun with a terminal disease, Booboo chose to get out into the wild and experience the unknown. After all—what’s the worst that could happen? Death? Hahahaha. But seriously, do you think it’s dangerous?

### Motivations

#### Wants/Needs:
Booboo is hoping to see as much of the wilderness as he can get his eyes on. He’d love directions (or better yet, an escort or three) to any notable vistas, scenic buttes or beautiful bodies of water — anything you think he ought to put on his “To See Before I Croak” list
#### Secret/Obstacle:
Booboo’s doctor didn’t mention it, but part of his reasoning for sending the man out into the wilderness is that he is extremely contagious.
### On Their Person
- $3.21 ; a foldable cot; a lantern; a portable cooking set; explorer’s pack; a gaming set; a set of fancy clothes; a rain slicker; flint and steel; a double-thick guidebook to the region; a stained hankie with a bit of wet blood and sputum in it.
