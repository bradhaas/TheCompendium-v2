## For the Perceptive
Carla absentmindedly juggles and cuts the deck with one hand without looking at it, suggesting a high degree of proficiency with cards.

## Summary

### Description 
A middle-aged kobold woman in a plain frock and good shoes. She appears to be fit and trim, with short red hair that frames her face and accents her startling light blue eyes. She carries a deck of cards in a clawed hand.
### Voice:
Boston townie voice
- *What the feck are you looking at chump*=
### Personality:
CARLA FEINT is a wanderer, recently run out of the last sizable town she lived in. She is a card sharp and con artist. Her specialty is three-card monte. She’s happy to take on anyone at any time, and will put down whatever she’s doing in order to accommodate. She’s got big time talent but can’t seem to gain the respect of actual criminals—and as such has yet to strike it rich as  
a con. She settles for the tips she receives as a backroom dealer once a week at a spot called The Shed
### Motivations

#### Wants/Needs:
Holding a regular day job (though she’ll do it when she has to) is simply no fun. Carla is looking for her first big score—she just needs a little muscle to back her up.
#### Secret/Obstacle:
Carla was born lucky, and while her confidence is inspiring, she’s never truly been tested. Her scheme to impersonate the escorts for a shipment of dwarven cast offs—the broken bits chipped off large gems in the refining process—could net her and her associates quite a bit of coin. But the legion who accompany the shipment have papers she’s not yet been able to forge.
### On Their Person
- 21sp, 22gp; leather shoes crafted for a quick getaway; a deck of cards; contact info for a man who can fence hot gemstones.

## Carla's Three Card Monte
Played like the standard game, but almost impossible to win. Carla is so proficient at the game a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check is unnecessary. In order to win against Carla, a creature must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check. If Carla suspects her opponent will succeed, she will unconsciously expend a Luck point to try and change the outcome of their original Wisdom (Perception) check.
