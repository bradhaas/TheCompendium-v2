## Summary


### Description 
A halfling freshly out of her adolescence who wears a look of suspicion, with hair stuffed under an oversized knitted cap and joints and fingernails black with trapped dirt. A grey and black pig nearly twice her size and loaded up with supplies nuzzles at her for attention.

For Animal Handlers
The pig with this halfling girl has pronounced lesions on its skin,  
a telltale symptom of an illness known as “greasypig.” Its condition will worsen if left unattended.
### Voice:
- Bright - even, well adjusted
- 

### Personality:
NIKKI BASIL WAS ONCE the epitome of “a nice halfling girl,” but then she fell in with “the wrong crowd.” Nikki and her friends, being so summarily dismissed from provincial norms by their neighbors, decided to embrace their title of “bad apples.” They committed every jape and misdemeanor they could think of, which included thieving a few herbs and spices from the local temple— substances the halfling elders would call “a bridge too far to cross to have a good time.” The mushrooms Nikki discovered expanded her view of the world, so much so that she left home in an effort to help others expand theirs. With the help of her good pal Floyd (who can sniff out a single tantric truffle in a 5-mile radius), Nikki wanders the countryside looking for ’shrooms and “astral curious” adventurers intrigued enough to try them.
### Motivations

#### Wants/Needs:
Secrecy is important for Nikki while she is on the hunt for tantric truffles. If anyone found her hunting grounds, she could lose her exclusivity on them.
#### Secret/Obstacle:
The other halfling “bad apples” Nikki used to hang around with just kept spoiling and are now legit bandits and cutthroats. They call themselves “The Halfwaymen,” and would like to get their hands on Nikki’s mushroom supply.
### On Their Person
- 11cp, 9sp; a few chunks of chocolate; 12 tantric truffles worth 250gp each.

## Tantric Truffles
These exotic fungi offer a passport to the astral plane. If ingested, a target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the target is under the influence of the astral projection spell. On a failed save, the target is under the effect of the phantasmal killer spell, with the source of the frightening visions projected in the mind of the target entirely up to GM discretion.
