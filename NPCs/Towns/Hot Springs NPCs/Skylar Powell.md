## Summary
A human woman in her mid-30s with a confused expression and cracked lips who seems extremely disoriented. She sports a brand behind her ear and hair so dirty it’s hard to place its color. She wears a nondescript tunic.
### Description
SKYLAR POWELL WAS with her family, she thinks, when it happened. That’s what’s so troubling—she isn’t sure. They were there, then they weren’t. Then she saw black, and a pale yellow, and heard the screams— but that’s about all she can recall. She knows where she is, she just doesn’t have a way to get back. Which is all she wants. Home. Where the smell of fresh cornbread and braised meats will overpower the scent of sulfur she can’t seem to shake from her sinuses. Home. Where her husband never leaves the door locked. Home. Where her young children are waiting, waiting to be held close enough to kiss forever.

### Motivations
- **Wants/Needs**: Skylar wishes  to be reunited with her family, whom she believes are roughly 40 miles down a nearby main road. She’s taken on odd jobs in hopes of raising the necessary funds to pay for the travel.
- **Secret/Obstacle**: While her memory is foggy, something certainly changed within Skylar just a few weeks ago. As it happens, she was subjected to the darker aspects of a horrific summoning ritual performed by a cult based in the nearby hills and will transform into a succubus following her next long rest.
