### For the Insightful
Clearly in a rush, Warlyn also seems to be upset about something, though he’s trying (poorly) to hide it.
## Summary
A potential customer of [[The Bathhouse Bartholomew]], he's having trouble working up the courage to go towards the river
### Description
A bronze-skinned human with close-cropped hair and a tidy beard wearing a leather jerkin over his beige top and a bright green cap on his head. An orange parrot sits on his shoulder.
### Voice:

### Personality:
THE WILDS ARE a difficult place to live, and men with scowls like Warlyn Stone’s make it even less welcoming. If he had a lawn, he’d be yelling at kids to get off it. He has trouble keeping work, even in this area where manpower is at a premium. Whether his temper makes it hard to find work, or a lack of work makes him angry is a ponderous question, but most in the area agree it’s likely a combination of both.

The parrot is a recent acquisition and one of Warlyn’s few friends. Warlyn spends most of his days mired in his grievances, trying to block out the voices from the past, and avoiding the riverbed in as many ways as he can.
### Motivations
- Knows that he needs 
#### Wants/Needs:
Warlyn is a loner, but not by choice and not by fault. There’s nothing he’d like more than a family. He had one once, and should fortune favor him with one again, he’d more than welcome it.
#### Secret/Obstacle:
Warlyn’s wife, son and daughter died tragically during a river crossing a few years back, an incalculable loss he’s not truly processed. He’s too busy trying to ignore the voice of his wife calling to him each time he goes near the river.
### On Their Person
37sp; a serrated knife; 30 ft. of rope; a leather haversack; four days of rations and water;  
a bright orange parrot named Phineas, whose voice is eerily similar to Warlyn’s wife’s.
