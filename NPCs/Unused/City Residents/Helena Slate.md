## Summary


### Description
A broad-shouldered woman who looks to be in her mid-50s, with thick, flowing red hair, skeptical eyes and a mug of ale cradled between her hands
- A half dwarf half human
- A STOUT, half-dwarven woman with dense red hair and the disposition of a cast-iron pan, Helena Slate has no time for those who can’t do for themselves, and is quick to cut off any who might be perceived as complaining. At 108 years old (on account of her dwarven heritage) she manages a rock and gem appraisal business on the side
### Voice:

### Personality:

### Motivations
- **Wants/Needs:**
	- Helena Slate would most like to be left alone, particularly if she’s being kept from her work by non-dwarves, especially humans.
- **Secret/Obstacle**:
	- Helena is exceptionally disrespectful of humans, in part because her noaccount human father left her dwarven mother nearly a century ago (and even half a dwarven grudge is enough to last four lifetimes).

### On Their Person
- 18cp, 2sp; 24gp in assorted gems; a rock hammer; a tattered map marking the location of a nearby mine with the note “Pa’s Last Stand.”
