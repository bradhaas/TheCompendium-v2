168 The Game Master’s Book of Non-Player Characters
![[Pasted image 20230825003035.png|300]]
## Summary

### Description
Riding atop a massive, armored white wolf is a gnome with a steely look in her eye—singular, because the other is sewn shut due to a deep scar that runs diagonally across her face, as if an axe had almost caved it in at some point. A walking miracle, she appears around 40 years old (by human standards) and is wearing a set of armored robes and electric-blue leather gloves.
### Voice:

### Personality:
Commander Harvash Taanwal has seen more death than most can imagine, a not insignificant amount of it occurring from her direct orders or intervention. During wartime, she commands armies and is a tactical mastermind, riding her white wolf, Skaarsbael, like a lightning strike across the battlefield in order to coordinate troops. During peacetime, Taanwal has command of tenuous border territories and roams the wilderness with a squadron of her best soldiers, keeping the monsters that threaten the realm at bay.
### Motivations

#### Wants/Needs:
Fiercely loyal to her Liege Lord, Maester Grandwall Packer, Commander Taanwal will protect her territory from whatever threatens it with her squad of warriors. Today? That means rounding up the yeti duo locals are calling the Twin Blizzard.
#### Secret/Obstacle:
Commander Taanwal is intensely distrustful of outsiders and it will often take more than words to get her on your side. She’s been tracking the Twin Blizzard for nearly a week. She’s not aware that they’re tracking her.
### On Their Person
- 21sp, 32gp, 76pp; Conduit Gloves; +2 armored robes; rations.
#### Conduit Gloves Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement)
These toasty leather gloves also help spellcasters harness the fury of the storm. Any time the creature wearing these gloves casts a spell that deals lightning damage, these gloves add an additional 1d10 lightning damage.
