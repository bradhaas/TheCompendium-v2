## Summary
A young human fresh into adulthood with hair that refuses to stay styled as he moves about wearing sturdy workmen’s clothes that are more pockets than not.

NORVILLE BERNARDE WAS transferred to the nearby Whitaker Ghast Laboratory for Artificing Achievements as part of his senior thesis—but he’s so past that now it seems foolish he was even trying to develop a new type of lever.

No, no—he’s done with levers and buzzers to boot. Norville’s got a new invention, more of a structure for inventions, but he knows it’ll change the world. Two contestants control pintsized constructs in combat, and to the winner go the spoils. He calls it the Gladiatron 4000 (on account of what would be its 4,000gp betting maximum). It started as a game, you know, for kids, but now he sees the money to be made, friends. Artificing isn’t cheap, not to mention the patent fees and other supply costs, so Norville is looking for backers. He’s approached several nobles or “sharks” due to their predatory nature, but alas none have bitten on his idea. What about you? You want to make some coin by giving him some?

### Description

### Voice:

### Personality:

### Motivations
- **Wants/Needs**: Norville needs his designs filed at the local patent office, which costs 25gp. He also needs materials to finalize his first construct competitors. He thinks another 50gp would get him
- **Secret/Obstacle**: Unbeknownst to Norville, one of his “sharks” is interested in putting Norville through a bit of gladiatorial combat and plans to have a group of thugs from the nearest town hit him for everything he’s got.

### On Their Person
- 11cp; 4sp; tinker’s tools; gears of various sizes; jeweler’s glasses; small chipped crystal ball; broken music box; 1oz block of unknown material; a book on martial combat; a dead sprite in a clear glass bottle; a diagram of two small constructs attached to the same base with two sets of controls.
