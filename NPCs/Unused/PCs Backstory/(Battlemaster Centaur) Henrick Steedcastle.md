## Summary

### Description
A sturdy and battle-hardened centaur who stands proudly on three legs, his hind right haunch scarred from a wound that cost him his fourth. His athletic form suggests a youthful vigor, but gray in his beard and at his temples belie his age.
### Voice:

### Personality:
An absolute unit on the frontline and divine strategist behind the scenes, Henrick Steedcastle persevered through the second fey rebellion, helped topple the Margaster empire, freed the Dogmen of Direhall Isle and is among the most accomplished field generals of his clan. Though his gallop has suffered a bit due to his injury, he maintains pace with other centaurs half his age through sheer pride. Yes, he only has three legs. Yes, he could still kick your teeth in. No, you cannot ride on his back.
### Motivations

#### Wants/Needs:
Henrick seeks admittance to the plane of Ysgard, where he would spend eternity killing and dying and waking anew on the endless battlefields that mark that realm of existence.
#### Secret/Obstacle:
Henrickâ€™s desire to ascend to the plane of Ysgard has made him reckless, which may get himself or his company killed in their next battle.
### On Their Person
164gp; a claymore he can wield with one hand like a lance; a +1 leather shield; +1 leather barding and armor; compiled notes on mounted military strategy from several different cultures in a small book.
