## Notes from Session -1
- Swarmkeeper Ranger
	- Flavored spells
	- Can push or pull people around
- Primary fighting style is long range high DPS
## Amelia's Character Inspo Document
- Name: not a final decision, but (something) Mellifera (she/her) - Loretta, Clara, Beatrice, Cassidy, Susie - Mellifera is the Latin species name for the honeybee
- Class/Subclass: Ranger - Swarmkeeper, think I’d like to multiclass later in to Fighter - Gunslinger
- Race: TBD, but I think human, maybe elf?
### General Concept Notes:
While I loved the nature focus of playing a druid, I really wanted to lean in to something more martial for campaign 2, so ranger was a natural choice! I’ve been looking at the swarmkeeper ranger for some time, and think the flavor of the subclass is great. While the “swarm” can be creatures of any sort, I’m going with bees! Sweet like honey, but with a nasty sting, and a complex eusocial matriarchal hive structure! I also love the idea of being a ranged attacker in a realm with firearms (having a six shooter nicknamed “honeycomb” is a must), so double dipping into the gunslinger subclass later on will probably make sense.

Mechanics: In combat, this character will be a ranged attacker, primarily using firearms as weapons (higher damage output than a bow/arrows, but the downside of being able to misfire). Subclass grants the ability to move enemy combatants around the field, and some movement bonuses to me. Adding in the gunslinger later will increase the effectiveness of my weapons and grant access to trick shots. Outside of combat, I’ll have some utility spells available (mage hand, cure wounds, pass without trace, arcane eye are all options I’m considering or are baked into the subclass)
Still undecided if I’m using the standard ranger rules or Tasha’s revised rules, but likely terrain would be grassland, favored enemy tbd

High stats are dex and wisdom, dump stats are strength and intelligence

Alignment: Chaotic Good (i.e. has a good internal sense of wanting to do the right thing, but hasn’t really developed a strict moral code; also maybe a bit quick on the trigger), not educated or straight laced enough to fit in with the temperance movement quakers of the Seneca Falls Convention, but not quite a stagecoach-robbing outlaw…yet
### Geographic Origin:
Somewhere in the plains country of the midwest, just past the frontier (Nebraska, Kansas, western Missouri area?) - a small and relatively insular town that is east enough to have access to firearms and some technology, but not at all cosmopolitan, accustomed to diversity, or on the direct route of western migration.

Call to adventure/personal goals:
1. The character is realizing that her ideals and independence are at odds with the traditionalist patriarchal social structure of her town of origin. She wants to leave home to become her “own woman”, whatever that means. She’s not quite sure yet, but knows it doesn’t involve sitting around darning socks while men make decisions on her behalf.
2. The bees have noticed something amiss in the natural balance around this town. They have their own independent desire to pick up and avoid this danger, whatever it is. She’s going with them, and to see if she can get to the bottom of this problem. And maybe prevent harm from coming to those left behind.
3. The bees have always been my companions since childhood, though as of late it’s been increasingly clear that there’s something supernatural about our connection. Is it magic? And if so, maybe going somewhere with more powerful magical forces could help me grow these abilities.

Personal Beliefs: early feminism, deep respect for the natural world and animals, rejection of the cult of domesticity but desperate to find a hive of her own, desire to be a path-paver and not a mindless drone
### Flaws:
inability to hold her tongue, general distrust of men in power, tendency to wander off into the wild without telling people where she’s going
### Appearance:
Prairie core/cottage core, gingham dress with work boots and breeches underneath (honeycomb in place of petticoats?), double blonde braids, straw sun hat with a retractable bee net for combat, fringe suede vest, freckles
