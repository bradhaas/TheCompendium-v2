## Notes from Session -1
- Looking at trickery domain cleric
	- Lots of spells / deceptions
	- Can make clones of herself and put around
- Race - thinking about being a fairy
	- background is fey lost - followed a racoon in to the forest one day that looked sparkly
	- Racoon was a trickster - trying to lure her in, but was saved by the fey and became a fey lost
	- had a wanderlust to leave the fey wild
	- fairies that adopted her were very sheltered and scared -
	- Pastor was really strict - that's the family that took her in
- One day see the racoon again, follow her out of the forest
- Aware that she isn't originally a fairy, has memories of being a normal kid
- A bit taboo to take a rumspringa
- Isolated cult of roughly 100 fairies
- No magic, no technology
- Rebecca, introduce self as rebecca lee
