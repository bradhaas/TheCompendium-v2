## Notes from Session -1
- Looking at trickery domain cleric
	- Lots of spells / deceptions
	- Can make clones of herself and put around
- Race - thinking about being a fairy
	- background is fey lost - followed a racoon in to the forest one day that looked sparkly
	- Racoon was a trickster - trying to lure her in, but was saved by the fey and became a fey lost
	- had a wanderlust to leave the fey wild
	- fairies that adopted her were very sheltered and scared -
	- Pastor was really strict - that's the family that took her in
- One day see the racoon again, follow her out of the forest
- Aware that she isn't originally a fairy, has memories of being a normal kid
- A bit taboo to take a rumspringa
- Isolated cult of roughly 100 fairies
- No magic, no technology
- Rebecca, introduce self as rebecca lee

### Battle Style

# Possible Classes
You mentioned you were interested in playing an Amish type character on rumspringa - one flass idea that I think could work well would be a Trickery Domain Cleric - more info is below.

[Cleric: Trickery Domain - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric:trickery)

I like this idea for you because it gives you the tools to play however you want - you can beceome invisible, manipulate people, disguise yourself, mirror image, teleport around, etc. That was one thing I always liked about how you played Tuf - you used her monk abilities to play the character in whatever chaotic way you felt like.
