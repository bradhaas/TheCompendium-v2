## Artificer Abilities
Artificer general abilities
[Artificer - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer)

## Artificer Specializations (Subclasses)
The above link has more info on all of these, but here's a summary
- Alchemist - You can do damage, heal, and induce various magical effects by brewing potions.
- Armorer - The "ironman" subclass - spec out a suit of armor to do crazy things. More ranged, more mobility than other classes, but expensive and very resource intensive to be good.
- Artillerist - Cannons and explosives galore. Can manufacture ammunition. Lots of DPS, but limited utility.
- Battle Smith - The "martial" artificer subclass. You're up in the mix, using Int and Con with a Steel Defender pet to back you up. You get abilities and bonuses for melee combat

## Other Class Ideas
