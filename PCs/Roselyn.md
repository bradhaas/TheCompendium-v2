Test edit from online

You mentioned you were interested in playing an Amish type character on rumspringa - one flass idea that I think could work well would be a Twilight Domain Cleric - more info is below.
### [Cleric - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric)
[Cleric: Trickery Domain - DND 5th Edition](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric:trickery)

I like this idea for you because it gives you the tools to play however you want - you can beceome invisible, manipulate people, disguise yourself, mirror image, teleport around, etc. That was one thing I always liked about how you played Tuf - you used her monk abilities to play the character in whatever chaotic way you felt like.
