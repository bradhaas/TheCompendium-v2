### DM Handbook Review
- DM Handbook
	-  [Concepts of Wilderness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#Wilderness)
	- [Wilderness Survival Tables](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#WildernessSurvival)
- Concept of "Marching Order"?
	- Party establishes and order or general jobs while travelling
	- eg one person is a scout, they can roll perception checks
- **Reward travelling rather than just require it**
- Foraging for Food and water
	- Survival checks against a DC that's based on how abundant food and water sources are
		- ABUNDANT is 10
