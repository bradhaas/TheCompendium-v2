## History
In 1673, [Father Marquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Marquette "Father Marquette") and [Jolliet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Jolliet "Louis Jolliet") explored the area and claimed it for [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France "France"). The [1763 Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1763) "Treaty of Paris (1763)") ceded the land to Spain; however, in 1800 control was returned to France until the [Louisiana Purchase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase "Louisiana Purchase") of 1803.

In December 1804, George Hunter and William Dunbar made an expedition to the springs, finding a lone [log cabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_cabin "Log cabin") and a few rudimentary shelters used by people visiting the springs for their healing properties. In 1807, a man named Prudhomme became the first settler of modern Hot Springs, and he was soon joined by John Perciful and Isaac Cates.

## Gossip
- Current govorner of the town [[Eirandriel Bellacane]] is just a puppeet for [[Borun Bartholomew]]
- [[The US Government]], they declared these springs as a "magically quarantined zone"
	- They claim that it's to study it's effects, and preserve the magic for research and safe disposal
	- But we all know that's a crock of shit
	- functionally speaking that just means that no new businesses can open on the hot springs
	- conveniently enough though, existing businesses get an exemption
	- So in the end, [[Borun Bartholomew|Borun]]'s father used some of his law school connections to ensure that [[#The Bathhouse Bartholomew]] would never see any serious competition
	- pathetic. So the best we can do as other 'legacy' businesses is make what money we can before [[Borun Bartholomew|Borun]] squeezes every last drop out of the place
	- Can't open new businesses, or close old ones
		- New businesses also want to capitalize on the m
- People heading west
- Monsters and magic seems to have been getting worse
