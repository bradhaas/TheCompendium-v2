## Native American Gods
- [Mythologies of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythologies_of_the_Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas)
	- Common elements are the principle of an all-embracing, universal and omniscient [Great Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Spirit "Great Spirit"), a connection to the Earth and its landscapes, a belief in a parallel world in the sky (sometimes also underground and/or below the water), diverse creation narratives, visits to the 'land of the dead', and collective [memories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory "Memory") of ancient sacred ancestors.
	- A characteristic of many of the myths is the close relationship between human beings and animals (including birds and reptiles). They often feature shape-shifting between animal and the human form. 
	- Marriage between people and different species (particularly bears) is a common theme. In some stories, animals foster human children.

Although most Native North American myths are profound and serious, some use light-hearted humor – often in the form of tricksters – to entertain, as they subtly convey important spiritual and moral messages. The use of [allegory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory "Allegory") is common, exploring issues ranging from love and friendship to domestic violence and mental illness.
